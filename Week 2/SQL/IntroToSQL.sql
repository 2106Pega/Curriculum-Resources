-- (What is structured? - let's us retrieve the data efficiently )
-- Strong preference for relationships between the data. 
-- Make it secure depending on how we structure it. 
-- Control over who has access to our data

--What is a relational database? 
-- We have foreign keys. 
-- Is used to stop database inefficiencies (stop redundancy)
-- In relational db, the data (i.e. tables) have references to other data (other tables), 
-- 	in practice this is foreign keys. 


-- What is SQL? 
--  Structured Query Language 
--	It is structued, adding or selecting, whatever operation we want to do with our table.
--  It's the language we use to speak to databases
--  SQL is NOT a general purpose programming language. It's a domain specific language, its 
--		syntax resembles spoken language to make it easier to understand what's going on. 
-- 5 sublanguages under SQL: 
--		Define and structure the data in my db  (DDL - Data definition language)
--		Manipulate the data, create, read, update and delete. (DML- Data Manipulation language / DQL - Data Query Language)
--		Control who has access to the database ( DCL - Data Control Language )
--		Manage Transactions on the db is also pretty important (TCL)
