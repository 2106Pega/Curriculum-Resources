Transaction (with DB)?
	Set of queries.

What is a query?
	record retrieval. 
	DQL.
	Applicable to any CRUD operations on our database. 
	Queries applie to any DML statemebts, create, read, update and delete. 
	(DML/DQL)


Properties that our transactions have to follow. 
	ACID. 
	Atomic : all the queries have to be executed or none of them do. 
	Consistency: Ensure that the database structure stays the same after a transaction. 
	Isolation: Exclusivity of a transaction when interacting with our db. 
		(Transaction does not intefere with another transaction)
	
		Serializable > Repeatable Read > Read Committed > Read Uncommitted. 

		What does isolation levels stop?
			Dirty Reads : a transaction reads something that has not 
				been committed to the database. 
			Non Repeatable reads 
			Phantom Reads 

	Durablity: Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed. 
		(regardless of local system failure).
